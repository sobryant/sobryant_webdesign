        <h6>Process (for final)</h6>
        <p>At first I planned to make a website for myself. The first six smaller photos show what I was planning on doing with my website. However after I tried some scrolling animations, I decided to change my idea. "If I'm not making a website for myself, who should I make a website for?" I thought to myself and after some brainstorming, I came up with the idea to make a website dedicated to a deer back home that had become a sort of town celebrity. "Plenty of animals have websites now" I thought to myself. Then I quickly made the bottom sketch which I translated to my final website.</p>
