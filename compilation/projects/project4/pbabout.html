He resides in the Radnor Lake preservation park. At a young age, PieBald became extremely popular due to his unique looks and was scouted, becoming subject to many photographer's work. PieBald's looks are due to a genetic mutation he was born with called, piebald, which is said to affect less than 2% of animals. This mutation can occur in other animals like horses and cows. It reates a background with a lack of pigment (white hair) with spots of the orignial pignment showing through. Ever since his discovery, PieBald has become increasingly popular and now keeps very busy with fans gawking at him in the park. In an exclusive interveiw I had with PieBald where he was about 100 feet from me, he responded to my question, "how does it feel to never get a rest of people crowding you in the park?" with "..." Very interesting. So far PieBald seems to be in perfect health and is safe from any hunters in the preservation.</h7>
